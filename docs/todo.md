todos: 
- expose prompting (both phases), 
- implement ai at link scrape, 
- log at bottom, 
- deploy??
- ? hovers, explanations, check boxes for (good, reject etc)
- right-align links (or somehow else)
- give the robot the url during extraction (?)
- add markdown preview for the fulltext of each page (this is what the model sees, the human should see it too)
- massively simplify the ai schlock code that should just be a single structured outputs call with a zod schema, for fuck's sake. fuckin' v0. Don't trust it with AI functionality apart from scrapping around, hey?
